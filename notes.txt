# --------------- Class #3: Models ---------------
Models = Data (Layer) = DB = SQL (not in this case)

In order to create a model we need to create a class inside of models.py
Class needs to inherit from models.Model in order to work
Each class that we create needs attributes (these ones are going to be the columns on our table)
Each attribute needs to belong to a data type (CharField, TextField, etc...)
Each class can have different functions (like dunder method str)
